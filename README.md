# HOLAPS

This code repository will make the source code of the High resOlution Land Atmosphere Parameters from satellite (HOLAPS) available to the user community.

Details about HOLAPS have been published in [Loew et al. (2016)](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2015-271/).

The code is currently undergoing a revision and is therefore not yet available. If you want to request the source code, please feel free to contact the author using the contact details given in the manuscript.
